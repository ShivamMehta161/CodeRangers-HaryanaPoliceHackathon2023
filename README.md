## Problem Statement
_The World Drug Report 2021_ by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) highlights that 275 million people used drugs worldwide in 2020. These figures likely underrepresent the actual scale of the issue, emphasizing the urgent requirement for an innovative communication strategy. The problem statement we aim to address is the rising challenge of drug abuse, particularly among today's hyper-connected youth.



### Brief Explanation of Problem
The crux of the problem lies in the widespread hesitancy, especially among the youth, to openly report incidents and engage in discussions concerning drug abuse. This reluctance creates a significant barrier to implementing impactful anti-drug measures. Overcoming this hesitancy becomes paramount in designing and executing communication strategies that encourage active participation, reporting, and dialogue.
